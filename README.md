This GitHub repository hosts the code for the **SpaceXplorer** project, a web application that allows users to explore information about SpaceX missions and capsules. The live app can be accessed at [https://spacexplorer.fun/](https://spacexplorer.fun/).

The project is built using the **Next.js** framework, which provides a powerful and efficient way to create server-rendered React applications. It offers features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and easy API integration.

For styling, the project utilizes **Tailwind CSS**, a highly customizable CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of utility classes for rapid UI development. Tailwind CSS enables responsive and visually appealing designs while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

To enhance the user experience, animations are implemented using **Framer Motion**. Framer Motion is a popular animation library for React that allows smooth and interactive animations, adding visual flair to the application.

The project's GitHub repository contains the complete source code, including components, Redux store configuration, API integration, and styling. It follows best practices for project structure and code organization. The repository is actively maintained, and contributions are welcome.



Feel free to explore the repository, contribute to the project, and join the space exploration journey with **SpaceXplorer**!
